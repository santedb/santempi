 *             is anything that occurs involving entities in which the entity's state is changed or is documented.
 *             
 *             Examples of Acts Include:
 *              - The administration of a substance to a patient - The observing of a value for the patient - An encounter or visit that occurs where the patient receives one or more services - Any other action such as supply request, or problem recordation

 *             The observation class itself is an abstract class which is generically used to represent something that is observed about a patient.
 *
